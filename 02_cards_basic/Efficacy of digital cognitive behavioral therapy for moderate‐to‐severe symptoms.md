## Abstract

To our knowledge, no previous meta-analysis has
attempted to compare the efficacy of pharmacological,
psychological and combined treatments for the three main
anxiety disorders (panic disorder, generalized anxiety
disorder and social phobia). Pre–post and treated versus
control effect sizes (ES) were calculated for all evaluable
randomized-controlled studies (n = 234), involving 37 333
patients. Medications were associated with a significantly
higher average pre–post ES [Cohen’s d = 2.02 (1.90–2.15);
28 051 patients] than psychotherapies [1.22 (1.14–1.30);
6992 patients; P < 0.0001]. ES were 2.25 for
serotonin–noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (n = 23 study
arms), 2.15 for benzodiazepines (n = 42), 2.09 for selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (n = 62) and 1.83 for tricyclic
antidepressants (n = 15). ES for psychotherapies were
mindfulness therapies, 1.56 (n = 4); relaxation, 1.36 (n = 17);
individual cognitive behavioural/exposure therapy (CBT),
1.30 (n = 93); group CBT, 1.22 (n = 18); psychodynamic
therapy 1.17 (n = 5); therapies without face-to-face contact
(e.g. Internet therapies), 1.11 (n = 34); eye movement
desensitization reprocessing, 1.03 (n = 3); and interpersonal
therapy 0.78 (n = 4). The ES was 2.12 (n = 16) for CBT/drug
combinations. Exercise had an ES of 1.23 (n = 3). For control
groups, ES were 1.29 for placebo pills (n = 111), 0.83 for
psychological placebos (n = 16) and 0.20 for waitlists
(n = 50). In direct comparisons with control groups, alland moclobemide, were significantly more effective than
placebo. Individual CBT was more effective than waiting list,
psychological placebo and pill placebo. When looking at the
average pre–post ES, medications were more effective than
psychotherapies. Pre–post ES for psychotherapies did not
differ from pill placebos; this finding cannot be explained by
heterogeneity, publication bias or allegiance effects.
However, the decision on whether to choose psychotherapy,
medications or a combination of the two should be left to
the patient as drugs may have side effects, interactions and
contraindications. Int Clin Psychopharmacol 30:183–192
