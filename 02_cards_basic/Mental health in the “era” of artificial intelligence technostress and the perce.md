## Abstract

Introduction
              The aim of the current study is to analyze the relationship between mental health and the accelerated implementation and use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Romanian society. Given the growing integration of AI technologies, understanding their psychological impact is increasingly relevant.
            
            
              Methods
              The perceived impact of the changes brought by AI technology was measured using the Technostress Creators Questionnaire. Mental health, assessed in terms of anxiety and depression disorders, was measured using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21R). Data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM).
            
            
              Results
              The results supported the proposed model and confirmed both tested hypotheses, indicating that anxiety and depression symptoms are significantly associated with AI-related technostress.
            
            
              Discussion/Conclusion
              Due to the cross-sectional design, the findings should be interpreted as associative rather than causal. Nevertheless, this study provides an important contribution to the literature, addressing a notable gap in research regarding the psychological implications of AI adoption in society.
