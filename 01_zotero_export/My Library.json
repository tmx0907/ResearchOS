  {"id":"carlEfficacyDigitalCognitive2020","abstract":"To our knowledge, no previous meta-analysis has\nattempted to compare the efficacy of pharmacological,\npsychological and combined treatments for the three main\nanxiety disorders (panic disorder, generalized anxiety\ndisorder and social phobia). Pre–post and treated versus\ncontrol effect sizes (ES) were calculated for all evaluable\nrandomized-controlled studies (n = 234), involving 37 333\npatients. Medications were associated with a significantly\nhigher average pre–post ES [Cohen’s d = 2.02 (1.90–2.15);\n28 051 patients] than psychotherapies [1.22 (1.14–1.30);\n6992 patients; P < 0.0001]. ES were 2.25 for\nserotonin–noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (n = 23 study\narms), 2.15 for benzodiazepines (n = 42), 2.09 for selective\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors (n = 62) and 1.83 for tricyclic\nantidepressants (n = 15). ES for psychotherapies were\nmindfulness therapies, 1.56 (n = 4); relaxation, 1.36 (n = 17);\nindividual cognitive behavioural/exposure therapy (CBT),\n1.30 (n = 93); group CBT, 1.22 (n = 18); psychodynamic\ntherapy 1.17 (n = 5); therapies without face-to-face contact\n(e.g. Internet therapies), 1.11 (n = 34); eye movement\ndesensitization reprocessing, 1.03 (n = 3); and interpersonal\ntherapy 0.78 (n = 4). The ES was 2.12 (n = 16) for CBT/drug\ncombinations. Exercise had an ES of 1.23 (n = 3). For control\ngroups, ES were 1.29 for placebo pills (n = 111), 0.83 for\npsychological placebos (n = 16) and 0.20 for waitlists\n(n = 50). In direct comparisons with control groups, alland moclobemide, were significantly more effective than\nplacebo. Individual CBT was more effective than waiting list,\npsychological placebo and pill placebo. When looking at the\naverage pre–post ES, medications were more effective than\npsychotherapies. Pre–post ES for psychotherapies did not\ndiffer from pill placebos; this finding cannot be explained by\nheterogeneity, publication bias or allegiance effects.\nHowever, the decision on whether to choose psychotherapy,\nmedications or a combination of the two should be left to\nthe patient as drugs may have side effects, interactions and\ncontraindications.

  {"id":"cuijpersPsychologicalTreatmentGeneralized2014","abstract":"Recent years have seen a near-doubling of the number of studies examining the effects of psychotherapies for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults. The present article integrates this new evidence with the older literature through a quantitative meta-analysis. A total of 41 studies (with 2132 patients meeting diagnostic criteria for GAD) were identified through systematic searches in bibliographical databases, and were included in the meta-analysis. Most studies examined the effects of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). The majority of studies used waiting lists as control condition. The pooled effect of the 38 comparisons (from 28 studies) of psychotherapy versus a control group was large (g=0.84; 95% CI: 0.71–0.97) with low to moderate heterogeneity. The effects based on self-report measures were somewhat lower than those based on clinician-rated instruments. The effects on depression were also large (g=0.71; 95% CI: 0.59–0.82). There were some indications for publication bias. The number of studies comparing CBT with other psychotherapies (e.g., applied relaxation) or pharmacotherapy was too small to draw conclusions about comparative effectiveness or the long-term effects. There were some indications that CBT was also effective at follow-up and that CBT was more effective than applied relaxation in the longer term.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2026",2,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Cuijpers","given":"Pim"},{"family":"Sijbrandij","given":"Marit"},{"family":"Koole","given":"Sander"},{"family":"Huibers","given":"Marcus"},{"family":"Berking","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Andersson","given":"Gerhard"}],"citation-key":"cuijpersPsychologicalTreatmentGeneralized2014","container-title":"Clinical Psychology Review","container-title-short":"Clinical Psychology Review","DOI":"10.1016/j.cpr.2014.01.002","ISSN":"0272-7358","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",3,1]]},"page":"130–140","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Psychological treatment of generalized anxiety disorder: A meta-analysis","title-short":"Psychological treatment of generalized anxiety disorder","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735814000038","volume":"34"},

  {"id":"pillayEthicalDecisionMakingGuidelines2025","abstract":"The meteoric rise in generative AI has created both opportunities and ethical challenges for the mental health disciplines, namely in clinical mental health counseling, psychology, psychiatry, and social work. While these disciplines have been grounded in well-established ethical principles such as autonomy, beneficence, justice, fidelity, and confidentiality, the exponential ubiquity of AI in society has rendered mental health professionals unsure as to how to navigate ethical decision making in the AI era. The author proposes a preliminary ethical framework which synthesizes the code of ethics of the American Counseling Association (ACA), the American Psychological Association (APA), the American Medical Association (AMA), and the National Association of Social Workers (NASW), which is then organized around five pillars: (i) autonomy and informed consent; (ii) beneficence and non-malfeasance; (iii) confidentiality, privacy, and transparency; (iv) justice, fairness and inclusiveness; and (v) fidelity, professional integrity, and accountability. These pillars are juxtaposed with AI ethical guidelines developed by multinational organizations, governmental and non-governmental entities, and technology corporations. The resulting integrated ethical framework provides a practical cogent structure that mental health professionals can use when navigating this uncharted terrain. A case study based on the proposed ethical framework and strategies that clinical mental professionals can consider prior to incorporating AI into their clinical repertoire are offered. Limitations of the framework and its implications for future research are addressed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2026",2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Pillay","given":"Yegan"}],"citation-key":"pillayEthicalDecisionMakingGuidelines2025","container-title":"Healthcare","container-title-short":"Healthcare","DOI":"10.3390/healthcare13233057","ISSN":"2227-9032","issue":"23","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",11,25]]},"language":"en","page":"3057","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Ethical Decision-Making Guidelines for Mental Health Clinicians in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Era","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/13/23/3057","volume":"13"}
